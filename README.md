## Project Description 
Go2Online is a web3 enabled video conferencing application. Our platform provides a place for DAO contributors, teams and groups to host meetings, online events and more. We allow teams to set up public or whitelist only video conference calls, store recordings of these videos on IPFS, mint POAPs directly within the video conference, and more to allow DAOs to better organize, connect and coordinate.

## How it's Made
We used IPFS/Filecoin in combination with web3.storage and nft.storage to store content such as Meeting Image NFTs, NFT Metadata, Acceptance NFTs (for meetings) and actual video recordings of any given video meeting. These video recordings are uploaded to IPFS and encrypted via LIT Protocol to store private data on the open web. Only team members with the meeting NFT (which you get upon accepting the invitation in the notifications tab) will be able to access given recordings in the meeting archive. XMTP is used to send notifications in real time to team members, as soon as someone creates a scheduled meeting. Specifically Hacky was the invention of our own OPEN POAP Protocol to allow team members and hosts to create poaps and claim said poaps. We found it was too much red tape to get our POAPS approved. We decided to go with our own version where anyone can generate a POAP for distribution. Initially these POAPS have a state of being unverified. They can still be distributed if the creator of a POAP wants to have a verified POAP they can contact us and we will approve it based on the details they provide. Hyperdapp & Tableland are leveraged for the Open Poap Protocol to store said information in Tableland and embed the UI/UX from Hyperdapp via iframe in our pages. Tableland stores the dynamic metadata for the POAPS.



# Next.js + Tailwind CSS Example

This example shows how to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [(v3.0)](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v3) with Next.js. It follows the steps outlined in the official [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs).

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=next-example) or preview live with [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/github/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss)
